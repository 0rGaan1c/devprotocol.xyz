The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## üöÄ How to Contribute:

- Please create an [issue](https://github.com/web3community/devprotocol.xyz/issues) first before creating a Pull request.

- Fork the Repo and create a Branch for any Issue that you are working upon.

- Create a Pull Request which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions would be added to improve it.

- Add Screenshots to help us know what changes you have done.

## Hacktoberfest Guidelines:

#### Good Practice
- Comment on the issue to get assigned
- Create an issue before you make a Pull Request

#### Bad Practice
- Creating Pull Requests without Issue assignment will not be accepted and will be closed

After this, project maintainers will review the changes and will merge your PR if they found it good, otherwise we will suggest the required changes.
